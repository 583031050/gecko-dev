## Bug Diagnosis
> Add a total transfer size for the entire connection (both upload & download ideally) 

> Via https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/feedback-wanted-websocket-inspector-in-devedition-70/46859/10

When tracking a websocket connection, the previous browzer gives a total size of all the messages for both upload and download, and we are try to separate them, so that the use can know which part (client or server) to tweak to reduce data usage.

## Solution
We have already be given the method iterates over all dispalyed frames and executes calculation. And we have ```frame.type``` to separate the data from received and sent, thuns, create two different variable and add each data to its variable.

## Testing
- Run ```./mach build``` to build Mozilla
- Run ```./mach run``` to open the browser
- Open the develop tool from the or use hotkeys ```ctrl+shift+e```
- In order to send a websocket message I use the online test website: https://www.websocket.org
