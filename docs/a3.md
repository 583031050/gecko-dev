## Diagnosis
There was a typo in `browser/base/content/aboutNetError.js`.
Issue with Symantec certificate is generally harmless and was not intended to display yellow border when the warning message was being shown to the user. 
However, due to a typo, it was not checking the condition properly and displayed yellow border.



## Solution 
This bug is caused by a simple typo, solution is to fix `erroCodeString` to `errorCodeString`
in `browser/base/content/aboutNetError.js`
